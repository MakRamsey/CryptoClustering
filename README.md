# Unsupervised-Segmentation


Greetings,

Welcome to the Unsupervised-Segmentation repository! This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Hvplot and Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA, StandardScaler) to leverage unsupervised machine learning to predict segments/clusters of Crypto currencies based on respective percentage price changes over specified time periods (24 Hours, 7 Days, 14 Days, 30 Days, 60 Days, 200 Days and 1 Year). 


**Repository Structure:**

- 'Resources': Contains the Crypto currency market dataset ("crypto_market_data.csv")
- "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb": Code for unsupervised machine learning segmentation

Thanks!
