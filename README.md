# CryptoClustering


Greetings,

Welcome to the "CryptoClustering" repository! The included code utilizes Python and unsupervised machine learning to predict clusters of different Crypto currency offerings based on relative price changes over specified time periods. The primary executed code is contaned within the Jupyter Notebook file "Crypto_Clustering.ipynb", which analyzes the dataset file "crypto_market_data.csv" included within the "Resources" directory.

Cheers!
